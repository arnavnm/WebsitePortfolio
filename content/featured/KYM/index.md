As part of my internship at CREDA, one of my projects was to build and analytics dashboard that tracked user activity across time and geography. I collaborated with the engineering team to develop a react based dashboard that utilised CREDA's Database to give user insight into medications, medical conditions and symptoms reported by the platforms users, as well as useful metrics such as DAUs and demogrpahics.
