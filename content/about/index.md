I love being surrounded in an environment of innovation. Working as an SWE at companies has made me aware that corporate companies are too big. While they try hard to preserve the values envisioned by its founders, they are too big and lack company culture. There is a lack of cohesion and a sense of belonging which is something I cherish while working.

I love the startup environment for the dynamism it brings with it. It is more fast paced, has more ups and downs, but eventually growth can be exponential. People and products are volatile and most of the times these new companies are driving revolutionary changes to the lives of its customers. I also find it much easier to work with small teams and see them grow. Cohesion becomes a necessity, and every entrepreneur has a new story trying to overcome a problem in society and witnessing a few such stories is something I strive for.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
